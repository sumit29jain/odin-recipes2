    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Dosa is a popular South Indian savory crepe made from fermented rice and lentil batter. It is a versatile dish that can be enjoyed for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Crispy on the edges and soft in the middle, dosa is typically served with coconut chutney and sambar, a flavorful lentil-based vegetable stew.</p>
        <p>One of the most appealing aspects of dosa is its adaptability. You can customize the filling according to your preferences, whether it's a classic potato masala, paneer, cheese, or even Nutella for a sweet variation. Dosa is not only delicious but also nutritious, as it is naturally gluten-free and low in calories.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup rice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup urad dal (split black lentils)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon fenugreek seeds</li>
            <li>Water (as needed for soaking and grinding)</li>
            <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
            <li>Oil or ghee (for cooking)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds separately. Soak them in water for 4-6 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Drain the water and grind the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds together to make a smooth batter. Add water as needed to achieve a pouring consistency.</li>
            <li>Add salt to the batter and mix well. Allow the batter to ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours or until it doubles in volume.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or dosa pan over medium heat. Pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the pan and spread it outwards in a circular motion to form a thin crepe.</li>
            <li>Drizzle some oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa. Cook until the bottom is golden brown and crisp.</li>
            <li>Flip the dosa and cook for another minute until the other side is cooked through.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with coconut chutney and sambar.</li>
        </ol>
